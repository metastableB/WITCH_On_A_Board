# Supported commands and their usage.

## Running commands
Commands can be run in two ways 
	MODE 1 A WITCH program has been selected and ready to run.
	MODE 2 No programs have been selected, but the WITCH has been started

The difference between 1 and 2 is that in 1 the stores will have been already cleared
and some intermediate calculations would have occurred. Stopping the WITCH and changing
internal states can cause undefined behaviours from within the WITCH (infinite loops and
so forth).

MODE 2 is when which has no loaded program. It has either finished a previous execution
or has just started up. The stores will have random values. This mode is mainly for 
demonstration and debug purposes.


## Commands

Strings included is '{' and '}' are aliases for the mentioned command.

### Running Programs 

    $ inp INPUT_FILE [OUTPUT_FILE]
	INPUT_FILE specifying path to Input file on disk. The file can only contain instructions,
	input numbers, or block marking character. At most one of any of them are allowed per line.
	
	If an OUTPUT_FILE is specified, the output will be written to it. If no file is specified,
	standard output will be used.
    
   $ run {r}
	Starts running the program till end/warning is reached. The input file should be preloaded 
	using 'inp' before using this command.

   $ continue {c} 
	Continue program from previously paused state till an alarm/finish/break point is reached.
	
### Modifying Internal Values
  $ set STORE_INDEX VALUE 
	Sets the value at the store specified by STORE_INDEX to VALUE. 	Both STORE_INDEX and VALUE have
	to be valid according to the following rules:
		STORE_INDEX : The original WITCH had 90 stores, indexed from 10 to 99,
			      though WITCH was never built to its full capacity. Hence, we restrict
			      the number of stores you can index by defining two parameters :
			      NO_OF_STORE_ROW and NO_OF_STORE_COL defined in definitions file. The
			      default values are 10 for each of them. 
	
			      The STORE_INDEX should be two digit numbers such that the first digit
			      represents the store row and lies in [1, NO_OF_STORE_ROW], and the 
			      second digit represents the column which should be in [0, NO_OF_STORE_COL]
		VALUE       : Value can be in the two forms. A + or - sign followed by 8 an 8 digit
			      number or an * followed by a 5 digit number.
