# Command line interface for the witch simulator

<<<<<<<<<<<< BRAIN  DUMP - START

We need basic functionality like 
	1) loading a program and checking for errors
	2) Initializing the WITCH and running the program
	3) Ability to step through the program
	3) Ability to print the output in stores
	4*) Ability to directly set store values
	5*) Ability to run single line commands on the WITCH like the python interface


The structure :

	Lets keep a WITCH object which will contain all the parts of the WITCH like the dekatron etc at ../
	In the current folder, adds a class that extends WITCH called the WITCH_Interface or someting
	this should inherit the WITCH and extend it. It should be the one WITCH accesses the WITCHES objects
	, have the getter and setter methods, does the initialization function etc.
