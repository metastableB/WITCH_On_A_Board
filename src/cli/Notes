# Command line interface for the witch simulator

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<START BRAIN-DUMP

We need basic functionality like 
	1) loading a program and checking for errors
	2) Initializing the WITCH and running the program
	3) Ability to step through the program
	3) Ability to print the output in stores
	4*) Ability to directly set store values
	5*) Ability to run single line commands on the WITCH like the python interface


The structure :

	Lets keep a WITCH object which will contain all the parts of the WITCH like the dekatron etc. at ../
	In the current folder, adds a class that extends WITCH called the WITCH_Interface or something
	this should inherit the WITCH and extend it. It should be the one WITCH accesses the WITCHES objects
	, have the getter and setter methods, does the initialization function etc.

## Notes

### From WITCH paper
	1) 8 Input tapes - should be able to turn them off as a preprocessor definition for 
	   hardware compatibility.
	2) First order always read from tape reader 1.
	3) Q : Orders can be drawn from dekatron stores ? How does it work ?
	4) The arithmetic instructions are :
				1 : Add
				2 : Add and Clear
				3 : Subtract
				4 : Subtract and clear
				5 : Multiply
				6 : Divide
				7 : Positive Modulus
	5) Q : All stores are cleared when the dekatron is first switched on. This is because the dekatrons can
	   start in any state randomly. Should we implement this ?
	
### From Programming Manual
	1) The *[5 Digit] form of input was intended to be used as the method of loading commands
	   to dekatron stores. This can also be used to load +ve numbers to the stores as well.
	2) NOTE : Windows line endings vs Linux endings while processing input from user.
