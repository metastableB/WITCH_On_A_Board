# Supported commands and their usage.

## Running commands
Commands can be run in two ways 
	MODE 1 A WITCH program has been selected and ready to run.
	MODE 2 No programs have been selected, but the WITCH has been started

The difference between 1 and 2 is that in 1 the stores will have been already cleared
and some intermediate calculations would have occurred. Stopping the WITCH and changing
internal states can cause undefined behaviours from within the WITCH (infinite loops and
so forth).

MODE 2 is when which has no loaded program. It has either finished a previous execution
or has just started up. The stores will have random values. This mode is mainly for 
demonstration and debug purposes.


## Commands

Strings included is '{' and '}' are aliases for the mentioned command.

	standard output will be used.
